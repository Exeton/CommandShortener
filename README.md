# CommandShortner
This is a spigot plugin used to shorten commands.

Example

Becomes
![Alt Text](https://github.com/Exeton/CommandShortener/blob/master/Pictures/Message%20Result.PNG)


All keywords and replacements can be configured in the config.yml file. Keywords will have a '#' added in front of them. This will only work for commands. If someone types #hacks in chat, it'll say #hacks.
