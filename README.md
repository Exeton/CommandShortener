All keywords and replacements can be configured in the config.yml file. Keywords will have a '#' added in front of them. This will only work for commands. If someone types #hacks in chat, it'll say #hacks.
  
## Configuration

Configuration is very easy. Simply enter the keyword followed by its replacement.The config should be in YAML format.
